This project was created in collabration with my partner Victor.

The goal of this project was to teach our classmates about coding and
introduce some of the basic concepts of coding. One of the requriement
the project faced was that it should include something that was
science related. We, therefore, decied to make a simplistic program
which would calculate the remaining number in the formula to calculate
wave speed: 
- Lambda * freqency = velocity.

To teach our fellow classmates about coding we created small challenges.
This was done by making the full program and then remove or replace
charactors or commands. The students then had to correct the code so
it would function as insially inteted.

In the science class where the project was used the level of familairity
to code differed very much, from no experience to new game delveopers. The
project therefore had to account for everybodies different levels and we
handled this by making two sets of acciments. One for
