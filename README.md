This project was created in collaboration with my partner Victor.

The goal of this project was to teach our classmates about coding and introduce some of the basic concepts of coding. One of the requirements the project faced was that it should include something science-related. We, therefore, decided to make a simplistic program that would calculate the remaining number in the formula to calculate wave speed: 

* Lambda * frequency = velocity.

To teach our classmates about coding we created small challenges. This was done by making the full program and then remove or replace characters or commands. The students then had to correct the code so it would function as initially intended.

In the science class where the project has used the level of familiarity to code differed very much, from no experience to new game developers. The project, therefore, had to account for everybody's different levels and we handled this by making two sets of assignments. One for the less experienced and one for the more experienced.

You can see the following in this project:

The project was very successful and taught many of the students something new about coding. Even the students who had never coded before learned some of the basics of coding with a bit of help from me and my partner.
